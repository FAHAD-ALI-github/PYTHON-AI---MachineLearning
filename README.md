# 🧠 PYTHON-AI---MachineLearning

Welcome! This repository is a **collection of projects, self-learning notebooks, and notes** that I created while exploring the world of **machine learning and data analysis** with Python.

Although I am primarily a **Web Developer**, I pursued this learning path to expand my skill set and understand how AI/ML can be integrated into modern web applications and data-driven platforms.

## 🧩 What's Inside

### 🚀 1. Web App: ML Data Analysis Tool (Streamlit)

This is a separate project hosted in another repository:  
🔗 **[ML Data Analysis Web App (Streamlit)](https://github.com/FAHAD-ALI-github/ML-DataAnalysis-App)**

It is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that allows users to:

- ✅ Upload CSV datasets
- 📊 Visualize data with interactive charts (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- 🧠 Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- 🧪 Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, etc.)
- 📥 Make predictions and download results

🌐 **Live App**: https://machinelearning-app.streamlit.app/

### 📁 2. Projects

> Hands-on machine learning projects with end-to-end workflows.

- `CreditCardApproval/`: Classification model for predicting credit card approvals
- `Hepatitus_project/`: Model for diagnosing Hepatitis based on patient data
- `saved_models/`: Serialized models for reuse (`.pkl`)
